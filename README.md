## Building CSS and JS assets

CSS and JS assets are included already compiled in the project. These files should never be modified directly. Make
any changes to the files inside the `src/sass` and `src/es6` directories instead and rebuild the files.

To compile install yarn and gulp and do

```
cd src
yarn
gulp
```
