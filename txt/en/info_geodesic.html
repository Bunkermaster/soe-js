<h2>Geodesic</h2>
<h3>The shortest line</h3>

<p>A <i>geodesic</i> is the shortest path between two points on the Earth. This path cannot be a straight line because we cannot traverse the interior of the Earth, we are restricted to move on the surface of the planet. In the same way, if we start moving forward a long distance, we can't go in a straight line unless we use some kind of spaceship. 
</p>

<p>If we start walking (or sailing) forward in any direction, without turning left or right, we describe a circle and eventually we make a turn around the Earth. We are "going away" until half of the trip, when we reach the antipodes of our start, and then we continue "coming back" by the other side. This circle is called a "great circle", because it has the maximum possible radius (that of the Earth). The antipodes are the point furthest to us, in any direction. The arcs (less than half circle) of those great circles are precisely geodesics, and their lengths give the distance between the points they join. </p>

<p>Theoretically, for any two points on the Earth, we can construct the geodesic that joins them, it is the intersection of the plane that contains the two points and the center of the Earth with the surface of the sphere. However, doing this in practice has been a big challenge for the mankind during centuries.</p>

A geodesic line, or a great circle.</center>


<ul>
<li>Select the <b>geodesic tool</b> and click on two points of the map. You will obtain the geodesic joining them and the distance between them.</li>
</ul>
