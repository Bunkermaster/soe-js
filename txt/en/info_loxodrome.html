<h2>Loxodrome</h2>
<h3>The rhumb line</h3>

<p>Whereas a geodesic is a desirable path to travel from one point to another, it is quite difficult to follow in practice on the Earth. We make detours on the ground, and find perturbating currents on the sea, so we change constantly the direction. How can we orient us?</p>

<p> The main reference for orientation is the direction of the North-South axis. Using the stars or (with certain accuracy) a compass, one can find the North direction without much problem. Then, we can navigate just keeping a fixed angle with the North. This fixed direction with respect to the North is called the <i>rhumb</i>, it is measured by an angle called <i>azimuth</i>, and the line it describes is called <i>loxodrome</i>. </p>

<p>Loxodromes are the easiest routes to follow, but in general they are not geodesic, so they are not the shortest paths. If we follow any loxodrome not perpendicular to the North, eventually we will start turning around the Earth spiraling towards the North in one direction and towards the South in the other. These spirals turn infinitely many times around the poles, approaching asymptotically but never reaching them. However, the length of these lines is finite, and equals the length of a meridian (20 000 km) divided by the cosine of the azimuth.</p>

<p>Rhumb lines have been key in history of navigation. First mathematical treaty of loxodromes was done by the Portuguese mathematician Pedro Nunes around 1537. Nunes noted the spiraling effect of the loxodromes, that close to the poles is approximately a logarithmic spiral. Under a polar stereographic projection, loxodromes are exactly logarithmic spirals.</p>

<p>Nunes proposed several methods to approximately represent loxodromes as straight lines, but it was the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator who in 1569 finally was able to draw a world map that rectifies loxodromes, using the projection that today bears his name. Perhaps surprisingly, Mercator produced his map heuristically, and it was decades later that it was described mathematically by English mathematicians (E. Wright, T. Harriot), and before the Scottish John Napier described in 1614 the logarithms, needed to write the formulas of Mercator projection.</p>
