<h3>The rhumb line</h3>

<p> The main reference for orientation on Earth is the direction of the North-South axis. Using the stars or (with certain accuracy) a compass, one can easily find the North direction. Then, we can navigate just keeping a fixed angle with the North. This fixed direction with respect to the North is called the <i>rhumb</i>, it is measured by an angle called <i>azimuth</i>, and the line it describes is called <i>loxodrome</i>. </p>

<p>Loxodromes are the easiest routes to follow, but in general they are not the shortest paths. If we follow any loxodrome not perpendicular to the North, we will start turning around the Earth spiraling towards the North or the South. These spirals turn infinitely many times around the poles, approaching asymptotically but never reaching them. However, the length of these lines is finite, and equals the length of a meridian (20 000 km) divided by the cosine of the azimuth.</p>

<p>First mathematical treaty of loxodromes was done by the Portuguese mathematician Pedro Nunes around 1537. Nunes noted the spiraling effect of the loxodromes, that close to the poles is approximately a logarithmic spiral. Under a polar stereographic projection, loxodromes are exactly logarithmic spirals.</p>

<p>Nunes proposed several methods to approximately represent loxodromes as straight lines, but it was the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator who in 1569 was able to draw a world map that rectifies loxodromes, using the projection that today bears his name. Perhaps surprisingly, Mercator produced his map heuristically, decades before of the description of logarithms by the Scottish John Napier (in 1614), required to write the formulas of the projection.</p>
