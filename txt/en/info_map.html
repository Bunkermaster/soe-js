<h2>Map projections</h2>
<h3>What is a map?</h3>

<p>A <i>map projection</i> is a flat representation of the surface of the Earth. There are infinitely many ways of representing the Earth on a
plane, but all of them will distort its appearance in some way. There is no perfect projection, and choosing one or another will depend on the purpose of your map.</p>

<p>In this program you can explore and compare the distortion of several map projections. Select one of the maps, move your pointer over the map and you will see some ellipses. These ellipses visualize the distortion of the map.</p>
