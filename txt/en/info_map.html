<h2>Map projections</h2>

<h3>What is a map?</h3>

<p>A <i>map projection</i> is a flat representation of the surface of the Earth. There are infinitely many ways of representing the Earth on a
plane, but all of them will distort its appearance in some way. There is no perfect projection, and choosing one or another will depend on the purpose of your map.</p>

<p> With this program we can compare different map projections, and explore their geometric properties.</p>

<ul>
<li>Select one <b>projection</b> from the list.</li>
<li>Select one of the four <b>tools</b> (Tissot's indicatrix, geodesic, loxodrome, aspect).</li>
<li>Choose the map appearance in the <b>View</b> menu.</li>
<li>Move and click the map to explore.</li>
</ul>
