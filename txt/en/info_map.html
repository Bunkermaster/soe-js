<h2>Map projections</h2>
<h3>What is a map?</h3>

<p>A <i>map projection</i> is a flat representation of the surface of the Earth. There are infinitely many ways of representing the Earth on a
plane, but all of them will distort its appearance in some way. There is no perfect projection, and choosing one or another will depend on the purpose of your map.</p>
