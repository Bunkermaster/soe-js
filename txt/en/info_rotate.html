<h2>Aspect of a map</h2>
<h3>Rotating the globe</h3>

<p>As we have seen, a map projection transforms the sphere onto a plane. We can, prior to apply this transformation, rotate the sphere in the space, so all the points, curves, and any object on the sphere is placed in a different position in space. If we apply the projection afterwards, all these objects are placed in a different (distorted) position in the plane than before.

Rotations on the sphere change the aspect.

<p> This way, we can make any point on the globe to appear at the center of our projection. In cartography, this is called the <i>aspect</i> of a map. Maps in <i>equatorial</i> aspect are centered at a point on the equator (usually the intersection of the equator with Greenwich meridian); maps in <i>polar</i> aspect are centered at one of the two poles; and maps in <i>oblique</i> aspect are centered at any other point of the globe.</p>

<p>Some maps are more interesting on one particular aspect. For instance, Mercator map displays loxodromes better in equatorial aspect, or the Azimuthal Equidistant map is better centered at our location.</p>

<li>Select the <b>Aspect tool</b> and drag the map to change the aspect. You can also choose the equatorial, polar or oblique aspects on the selector.</li>
