<h2>Orthographic projection</h2>

<p> This map looks like a 3D representation of the Earth, but it is a drawing as flat as any other projection. To obtain this map, we project each point of the sphere on a plane perpendicular (orthogonal) to the line of sight, assuming that we are far enough (mathematically at infinity) so all lines of sight are parallel. </p>

<p>Thus, this map belongs to the same family that the gnomonic and stereographic projections, the family of <i>perspective</i> projections obtained by casting rays of light (or lines of sight) from a source, passing through a point of the sphere, and intercepting a plane to define the projeted point.<p>

<p>Besides of cartography, this projection is naturally used in the representation of all types of three-dimensional objects, such as in computer graphics, technical and engineering graphics, photography, radiography, microscopy, etc.</p>

<li>What shape adopt parallels and meridians? </li>
<li>If we take a picture of the Earth from the space, we are not at an infinite distance. What would be the difference with this projection?</li>
