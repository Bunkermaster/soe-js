<h2>Stereographic projection</h2>

<p>This map is obtained geometrically, projecting each point on the Earth's surface from a fixed point on the Earth (the source of light) to the plane tangent on the antipodal point of the source. This is similar to the gnomonic projection, but the source of light now is on the surface of the sphere instead of its center.</p>

<p>If you draw some Tissot ellipses, you will notice that, like on Mercator's map, all of them are circles and hence this map is also conformal (preserves angles). Furthermore, not only the infinitesimal circles are represented as circles (as Tissot's indicatrix shows), but <i>any</i> circle on the sphere is projected onto a circle on the plane (some circles are actually projected on straight lines, which can be thought as circles of infinite radius). This makes the stereographic projection "very" conformal. This projection was already known by the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, making this the oldest conformal projection.</p>

<p>Geodesics are arcs of great circles, and thus they are represented as arcs of circles. Loxodromes aren't represented as straight lines as in Mercator, but they adopt also a particular shape: with the projection in polar aspect (North or South), loxodromes are traced as logarithmic spirals; that is, the distance to the center grows exponentially with the turning angle. On all map projections loxodromes approach logarithmic spirals close to the poles, but this is the only one that the spiral is exactly logarithmic.</p>

<ul>
<li>Which circles of the sphere are not projected onto circles but onto straight lines?</li>
<li>What shape adopt parallels and meridians? What is the distance between parallels in polar aspect?</li>
<li>If a geodesic is represented as a circle on the map, where is located the center of this circle? In general, if a circle projects onto a circle, what is the relation between their centers?</li>
</ul>
